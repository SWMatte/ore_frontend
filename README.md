# OreFrontend

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.2.11.

## Development server

Run `ng serve`  or `npm start `for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Info
This project is the front-end application of - [HourWorked](https://github.com/SWMatte/HourWorked) - where you can build and call the endpoints


## How to use this project

1) You need to clone the back-end ( you can find the link below )
2) You need MySQL for the tables ( until i'll develop generate user / company you need to use postman to create a user and company)
3) After you have instance of one user and company you can use front-end application to save your hoursworked and generate the xls file

# important recommendations
This is not the last update of this project, but right now it works with some corrections like build manually user and company.
When you run it in localhost:4200 you'll see a login interface you MUST compile it with the same name of the user you want create the xls file. Otherwise you could meet some issues with the data
Actually it works only with one user on the db, because it was projected for own interaction ( to switch for multiple users you need to change the queries )


## Future implementation

Add token for the login 
Add iteraction for multiple users 
Add components for profile users
